This is the evaluation for Module 1 of the devMint Course. To initialize this repository, please run the following command:

`npm install`

You should then be able to run the following code:

`npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy_base.sol`

... and it should complete without error.

Please clone this repository to your github, and then for each of the scenarios, create a new solidity file (for example `Scenario_1.sol`, `Scenario_2.sol`, ect.).

You are expected to complete as much of these scenario's as possible. If you have specific question, please reach out to your instructor. Once you have completed this evaluation, please push the code to your private repository (do not share this with your peers) and send it to the typeScript. Upon completion, you will be sent the answers.
